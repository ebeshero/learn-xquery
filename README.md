# Learn XQuery: A list of great articles, blog posts, and books for learning XQuery

Let's show the world how to learn XQuery. Pull requests welcome. Quality over comprehensiveness - just the best, most helpful resources, please. Talk about [`#xquery`](https://twitter.com/search?q=xquery) on Twitter. 

Also, check out these [resources powered by XQuery](https://github.com/joewiz/xquerypower), [repositories with XQuery on GitHub](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language%3AXQuery&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults), and [questions about XQuery on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/xquery).

## In-depth introductions

Some people can learn languages by reading online tutorials. Some people like to dive into a book, or have one on their shelf for reference. Listed in chronological order by date of printing, newest to oldest.

- [XQuery for Humanists](https://www.tamupress.com/book/9781623498290/xquery-for-humanists/), Clifford B. Anderson and Joseph C. Wicentowski, Texas A&M University Press, 2020. An introduction to XQuery accessible to non-programmers. Has a running focus on use cases related to research in the humanities. See also the book's [companion website](https://xquery.forhumanists.org). 
- [XQuery, 2nd Edition: Search Across a Variety of XML Data](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035589.do), Priscilla Walmsley, O'Reilly, 2015. The standard text for XQuery, available in a second edition, updated for XQuery 3.1. Also introduces [functx](http://www.xqueryfunctions.com/). 
- [eXist: A NoSQL Document Database and Application Platform](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026525.do), Erik Siegel and Adam Retter, O'Reilly, 2014. Introduces approaches to building applications with one popular XQuery-based platform, eXist. Example code for the book is [on GitHub](https://github.com/eXist-book/book-code).
- [XQuery from the Experts](https://www.amazon.com/XQuery-Experts-Guide-Query-Language/dp/0321180607), A bit dated (2003), and only available second-hand, but its coverage of the concepts and purpose and role of the language makes it more than just a tutorial or reference manual.
